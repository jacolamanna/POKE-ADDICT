# POKE-ADDICT

"Poke And Delayed Drink Intertemporal Choice Task" (POKE-ADDICT) is an open-source, versatile, and cost-effective apparatus for intertemporal choice testing in rodents.
It allows quantification of delay discounting (DD), a cross-species phenomenon observed in decision making which provides valuable insights into higher-order cognitive functioning.

In DD, the subjective value of a delayed reward is reduced as a function of the delay for its receipt. Using our apparatus, we implemented an effective intertemporal choice paradigm for the quantification of DD based on an adjusting delayed amount (ADA) algorithm using mango juice as a reward.
